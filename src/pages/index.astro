      <p class="mb-4">
        Hey there! I'm Blake, and I'm absolutely passionate about coding,
        servers, and homelabs. I'm a developer and support staff member at
        Rabbit Company, where I get to dive into code and keep servers running
        smoothly.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        My coding journey spans across various languages, and I've mastered the
        art of debugging servers to ensure everything runs like a charm.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Join me as I share my experiences, projects, and insights into the world
        of coding and technology.
